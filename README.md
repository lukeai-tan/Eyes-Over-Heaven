# Eyes Over Heaven - Visual Sorting Algorithm

## Description
I designed a visualiser that offers 5 sorting algorithms for visualisation. I took inspiration for the name "Eyes Over Heaven" from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure's "Made In Heaven" because it depicts rapid time acceleration, similar to how this program visualises sorting. 
To use the program, just input the number associated with the sort shown on the terminal.

## Sorting Algorithms
### Insertion Sort
I increased the delay time between each comparison to make the swaps more noticeable, which is more of a personal choice. The sorting time is way too fast to see the process normally.

### Bubble Sort

### Merge Sort

### Quick Sort (WIP)
The visualisation for quick sort is pretty janky. There is a lot going on that I couldn't translate visually. It is a work in progress.
### Bogo Sort
I added Bogo Sort as a joke. If you select Bogo Sort, the chance of the list being sorted is $1/99!$, which is almost zero. Half-Life 3 will release before you get to see Bogo Sort sort the list.
