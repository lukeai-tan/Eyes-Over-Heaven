# Eyes Over Heaven - Visual Sorting Algorithm

## Description
I designed a visualiser that offers 5 sorting algorithms for visualisation. I took inspiration for the name "Eyes Over Heaven" from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure's "Made In Heaven" because its power involves rapid time acceleration, similar to how this program visualises sorting. 

## Usage
To use the program, just input the number associated with the sort shown on the terminal. </br>
A list of 99 elements will be randomly generated and then sorted. </br>
Once the list is sorted, the program will end and the window will close. </br>

## Sorting Algorithms
### Insertion Sort
I increased the delay time between each comparison to make the swaps more noticeable since the sorting time is way too fast to see the process normally. This is a personal choice.

### Bubble Sort
NIL

### Merge Sort
NIL

### Quick Sort (WIP)
The visualisation for quick sort is pretty janky. There is a lot going on that I couldn't translate visually. It is a work in progress.

### Bogo Sort
Disclaimer! You will not live to see Bogo Sort sort the list. </br>
I added Bogo Sort as a joke. If you select Bogo Sort, the chance of the list being sorted is $1/99!$, which is very close to zero. </br>
Half-Life 3 and Silksong will release way before the list gets sorted. </br>
Since the list won't be sorted, you will need to manually close the terminal window to end the program.
